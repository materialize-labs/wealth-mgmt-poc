[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET,NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE&envDescription=Required%20environment%20variables%20for%20the%20application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgenerate-secret.vercel.app%2F32&project-name=industry-ai-chatbot&repository-name=industry-ai-chatbot&demo-title=Industry%20AI%20Chatbot&demo-description=AI%20Chatbot%20with%20modes%20for%20Wealth%20Management%20and%20Real%20Estate%20Private%20Equity&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai)

## Running Locally

You will need to use the environment variables defined in `.env.example` to run the application locally. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Switching App Modes

To switch between industry modes:

1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE` to either:
   - `wealth-management` (default)
   - `repe` (Real Estate Private Equity)
3. Restart the development server with `pnpm dev`

The app will automatically adjust its data sources, system prompts, and UI elements to match the selected industry focus.

## Model Providers

This application uses the Vercel AI SDK and supports multiple model providers. The default is xAI's Grok, but you can easily switch to other providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere by updating the model configuration.
