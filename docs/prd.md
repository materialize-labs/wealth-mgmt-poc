# Wealth Management Unified Data Access Platform - Proof of Concept

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a non-functional proof of concept (PoC) showcasing a unified data access platform for wealth management firms. The PoC will demonstrate how a conversational AI interface could integrate with three critical systems (Outlook, Addepar, and Salesforce) to provide seamless data access and personalized client touchpoints. This PoC will simulate functionality without implementing actual backend integrations, using canned responses and scenarios to showcase the potential of a fully developed product.

## 2. Background and Strategic Fit

Wealth management firms face two critical challenges:

1. **Data Silos**: Information is fragmented across multiple systems, creating operational inefficiencies.
2. **Client Engagement**: Traditional wealth management focuses primarily on portfolio performance, missing opportunities for deeper personalization.

This PoC will demonstrate how a unified data platform with AI-powered personalization could transform wealth management by:

- Simulating the integration of siloed systems through a natural language interface
- Showcasing how personalized touchpoints beyond portfolio management can enhance client relationships
- Demonstrating a path to more efficient and comprehensive client service

## 3. Product Objectives

- Create a visually compelling, non-functional PoC that demonstrates the concept's potential
- Simulate integration with key wealth management systems (Outlook, Addepar, Salesforce)
- Showcase a "Beyond the Portfolio" client profile feature for personalized engagement
- Present realistic scenarios of how wealth managers could use the platform
- Generate excitement about the potential of a fully developed solution
